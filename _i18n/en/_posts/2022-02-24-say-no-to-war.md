description: Say no to war
---
I wish I could stop this war,  
But I can't – it's against the law  
That I never accepted. Power's  
Got over me. Kremlin's towers  
Are covered in blood, they lure  
All the demons that were obscure.  
How can I now imagine the future   
Of loved peace that is being tortured?  
Running off and hiding in awe  
I pray God, escalate no more,  
Don't turn tables of negotiation,  
Stick to the proper legislation,  
Be the one I'll be proud of,  
Do not make the world hugely rough.  
Let your eyes see and soul freshen –  
No one wants to die in oppression.
