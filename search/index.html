Nastya BeyzerBut the song was actually about me getting out of depression that was severe enough to get me to the ICU with COVID and an immunity failure. When I almost ‘kissed’ the death, I figured out I gotta take responsibility for my life and bear the heavy burden of it. Accepting it, I survived and went along. But I couldn’t do it without my named father whom I dedicated my poem to. It was his light of love and hope that filled my song and charged my soul so I could stand on my own feet. The song wasn’t easy to master vocally. It features 2 octaves of vocal range, and I’m still having hard times hitting those high notes after the bridge part. I wanted this song to be perfectly sounding, so I recorded live instruments: the Steinway piano, violin and cello. And I recorded live voices of 20 people that mixed in a six-part choir. Many of them got through those tough times in their life, so they put the feelings I needed for the record. I am grateful to them and all sound engineers who worked with me and made the piece sound really decent. Also I really wanted two female voices to shine in my song, they are of Polina Surnacheva and Eugenia Lukina. They hit perfectly my expectations about them and made the song even more powerful! The single consists of two tracks. One is the solo version, the other one is the full version. People that listened to it used to tell me that they felt better, happier and more motivated. So the song is quite psychotherapeutic! And here are the lyrics: You’re feeling down,Nothing could be worse,You always frown,Life goes in reverse. Depression has become a part of you,Can’t figure out what you’re supposed to do. You’d be alrightIf you could make one stepTo your deep frightThat triggers your soul’s ebb. I know: that pain could be transformed to life,Your heart will get opened and your love will find you out. We’ve got toMove on,We’ve got to move it on. So give awayAll your crazy dreams,Don’t go astray,Keep your merry beam!Although you may feel like you’ve lost it all,It’s worth it to believe you can do more. You may be sureThat life is such a painYou can’t endure,And nothing’s there to gain. You’re paralyzed from overwhelming woe…But here comes the power telling you: “Rise up and go!” We’ve got toMove on,We’ve got to move it on. Where is your placeTo fight disgrace?Do you have a courage to forgive?How can you make your world a better place to live? You will succeed!Go plant good seeds! We’ve got toMove on,We’ve got to move it on. null by Pavel Shlepnev"

I wondered why not use them in the production of the next series? It seems like fan art is usually not so interesting to the authors. Or not? In any case, concerning the widespread development of Internet, it appears weird that so far I haven’t encountered any platform where fans extend the creation of authors, and authors extend the fans. Therefore, I decided to ‘invent the wheel’ and build a platform entitled “Artcascade”. You post your content, someone extends it, and you get your fee. The more the number of your extenders, the more money you get. I’m looking for authors to test the site’s functionality and get some feedback. There is already some interesting content there!

No one would argue the song ain’t that good, otherwise it wouldn’t be one of the best-selling songs of all time according to Wikipedia. What is most catchy for me is the chord progression used in the song. And now it’s the “Get Lucky” brand wherever I hear these chords in other songs. So I couldn’t hold myself not to compose an arrangement. And here it is, as piano scores! It starts from refraining the chorus in a smooth rhythm, next flashes of chords break in accompanying “She’s up all night ‘til the sun”, then your fingers dance with the piano. ‘Coda 2’ is for the second verse with flat chords in the right hand and the baseline in the left hand resembling the synth solo in the original song. It should go something like this: Doesn't play in your browser. . . Download it for free! "
